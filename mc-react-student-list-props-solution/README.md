# Student List (Components + Props)
### `Morning challenge | javascript, react`

## Learning objectives
- breaking up JSX code into components
- using props to pass data down between components
- using javascript knowledge to generate lists of components faster

## Instructions
For this challenge, you're breaking the provided app into smaller React components, and using props to pass data through instead of hard-coding them.

- The Student names are currently hardcoded into the html, add the strings to an array in the App Component, and generate them from the array instead.
- Pass the array of student names down to a component that you created in step 1 that displays a list of students.
- Use map to convert the array of students into the appropriate HTML output.
- **Note**: The Add Students Form does not need to be functional at this time.
